# djmaps

This project is a map database. This is a social site in which users can share maps with others. Users can not only share a place to travel like Tripadvisor ( https://www.tripadvisor.com/ ), but also share filming locations, etc. Users can submit a name of the place, tags such as 'filming locations', and the latitude and longitude. Users can view maps. Users can keep their maps privately, share with friends and open to public.
